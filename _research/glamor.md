Current models such as BERT have great accurary for the most famous Adversarial Analogy problem: **Man** is to **King** as **Woman** is to **Queen**. However, when it comes to tricker problems such as "**Glass** is to **Shatter** as **Rubber** is to **Bounce**" or "**Yellow** is to **Rife** as **Black** is to **Rot**", current models have low accuracy.

We propose using a web page to collect and create a dataset of Adversarial Analogy problems and train new models that outperform existing ones regarding these Adversarial Analogy problems.
